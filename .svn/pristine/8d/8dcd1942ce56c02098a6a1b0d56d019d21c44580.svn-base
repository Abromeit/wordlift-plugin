WordLift is a WordPress Plug-In to enrich user-created text (a blog post, article or web page) with HTML Microdata and to improve content findability.

== Description ==

Great news for our folks following us on the (Semantic) Web. We finally launched **WordLift 2.0** in beta with the aim of getting real feedback from our current and new users and of delivering the best Semantic plug-in for WordPress. Read [the full announcement](http://wordlift.insideout.io/wordlift-launches-in-beta/) and join our beta testers. Follow the instructions on our blog to participate.

Please note that at this stage WordLift 1.6 is non-operational.

**WordLift** is a WordPress Plug-In developed by [InSideOut10](http://www.linkedin.com/company/2184022?trk=tyah "InSideOut10 on LinkedIn") to enrich user-created text (a blog post, article or web page) with *HTML Microdata* and to improve content findability.
 
WordLift *reads* your pages or blog posts, *understands* it and *enriches* it by querying the semantic web and by adding the most relevant information using *HTML Microdata*. All the information retrieved can be manually edited by the author of the post (or page) and uses a markup vocabulary that all major search providers (Google, Bing and Yahoo!) recognized. 

Through a simple Plug-In all your contents will be instantly compliant with schema.org specifications for a better SEO.
 
 * Attract more search traffic
 * Compatible with WordPress 3.1 and above
 * Eye-catching supplementary SERP data
 * Instantly review and markup old post
 * Use the schema.org vocabulary
 * Add HTML Microdata

The Plug-In uses [IKS](http://www.iks-project.eu/ "visit the IKS website") (Interactive Knowledge Stack) an open source technology for semantically enhanced Content Management Systems (CMS).

WordLift is currently enhancing content entities related to people and places.

For more information on the vocabulary used by WordLift you can visit [Schema.org](http://schema.org/ "Schema.org website") 

== Installation ==

2. Extract the files in the wordlift subfolder
3. Activate the plug-in

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can this plug-in increase the content fundability of my blog? =

WordLift adds HTML Microdata using Schema.org vocabulary; Schema.org was designed by engineers from *Google*, *Yahoo* and *Bing* to make search engine results better and easier to use.
WordLift allows you to provide attributes for sections of your web pages, this makes it easier for the search engines to extract specific information from the content of your pages with less guessing and this is likely to result in more precise results, inclusion of more information in the search engine result page and a better ranking.

There are many factors that shall be consider and for an in-depth understanding of what Schema.org means for SEO we suggest you the reading of [this article](http://www.seoskeptic.com/what-schema-org-means-for-seo-and-beyond/ "What Schema.org Means for SEO and Beyond").

== Screenshots ==

1. WordLift button appears on the editor toolbar: by clicking it WordLift will send the text of your article to our content enrichment platform.
2. Here WordLift is analyzing the text provided and it is extracting the main content entities (limited to people and places for the current version); for each one it will query the semantic web and it will gather the information required by Schema.org to properly markup your pages.  
3. The entities WordLift found shall be selected using your mouse and holding Shift or Command Key (Apple users only). Once the article is saved the proper markup will be shown in the HTML of the page and it can then be tested with the [Google Rich Snippets Testing Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets)
