/**
 * Tests: Issue 662
 *
 * JSON-LD is generated by the plugin when the an AJAX call is made. JSON-LD
 * can be generated for the WebSite or for a post/entity. Issue #626 is about
 * caching the JSON-LD for posts/entities.
 *
 * The AJAX request calls the {@link Wordlift_JsonLd_Service} `get` function which
 * in turn uses `get_jsonld`. This is the function we're going to test: we want
 * to test the different caching conditions. The test context is to generated
 * some posts and entities and connect them together and see how the cache reacts
 * when the requested entity or a referenced entity is changed.
 *
 * Tests:
 * - create some posts,
 * - create some entities,
 * - connect posts to entities,
 * - connect entities to entities,
 * - get the JSON-LD of a post (1st time not cached),
 * - get the JSON-LD of a post (2nd time cached) ,
 * - get the JSON-LD of an entity (1st time not cached),
 *
