Supercharge your WordPress Site with Smart Tagging and #Schemaorg support - a new way to write, and publish your contents to the Linked Data Cloud.

== Description ==

**WordLift** is a WordPress Plug-in developed by [InSideOut10](http://www.insideout.io) to help you organise your post and pages using "concepts" like you do in the real world. 

We now feature the **WordLift Bar** with the list of entities and links to the entity page right within your blog. WordLift Bar is *experimental*, if you encounter any issue you can disable it from the plugin options and report us any trouble or suggestion.

You can view some examples of the WordLift Bar:
 * English: [demo 1](http://bit.ly/wlbar-english)
 * Russian: [demo 2](http://bit.ly/wlbar-russian)

**Warning:** WordLift is still under heavy testing, therefore some features might not work as expected or not work at all. Should you encounter any issue while installing, activating, configuring and using the plug-in, we would love to receive your feedback to support [AT] wordlift.it

"Concepts" are just like tags but let you add structure to your information providing you and your visitors many ways to filter and visualize your content. 

We developed WordLift with love because we believe that your website deserves a special place in the Semantic Web.

WordLift reads your pages or blog posts, understands it, *enriches it* by querying the semantic web and tags them using a markup vocabulary that all major search providers (Google, Bing, Yahoo! and Yandex) recognise. 

Through a simple Plug-in all your contents will be instantly compliant with [schema.org](http://www.schema.org) specifications; moreover WordLift will add to your blog an interface to ask *meaning-driven questions* about your contents (hence connecting your website to the Linked Data Cloud).

 * Organize your contents using "Concepts" (or Entities)
 * Treemap, Geomap and Entity List available as add-on Widgets
 * Multi-language support (see below)  
 * Attract more search traffic
 * Compatible with WordPress 3.3.0 and above
 * Eye-catching supplementary SERP data
 * Instantly review and markup old post
 * Use the [schema.org](http://www.schema.org) vocabulary
 * Add HTML Microdata
 * Enable a SPARQL end-point for your site

WordLift currently supports the following languages: English, 中文 (Chinese), Español (Spanish), Русский (Russian), Português (Portuguese), Deutsch (German), Italiano (Italian), Nederlands (Dutch), Svenska (Swedish) and Dansk (Danish). 

The Plug-in is powered by [RedLink](http://redlink.co): Europe's *open source* largest platform for semantic enrichment and search.

= Which version of WordPress do you support? =

= What is an "entity"? =

An entity is something that exists in the real-world: celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects and works of art are all entities. WordLift by reading your posts and pages understands the real-world entities associated with your contents as well as their relationships —in geek-speak— it builds a “graph” of your website.
