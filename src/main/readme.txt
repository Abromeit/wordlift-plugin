Supercharge your WordPress Site with Smart Tagging and #Schemaorg support - a brand new way to write, organise and publish your contents to the Linked Data Cloud.

== Description ==

**WordLift** is a WordPress Plug-in developed by [InSideOut10](http://www.insideout.io) to help you organise your post and pages using "concepts" like you do in the real world. 

"Concepts" are just like tags but let you add structure to your information providing you and your visitors many ways to filter and visualize your content. 

We developed WordLift with love because we believe that your website deserve a special place in the Semantic Web.

WordLift reads your pages or blog posts, understands it, *enriches it* by querying the semantic web and tags them using a markup vocabulary that all major search providers (Google, Bing, Yahoo! and Yandex) recognise. 

Through a simple Plug-in all your contents will be instantly compliant with [schema.org](http://www.schema.org) specifications; moreover WordLift will add to your blog an interface to ask *meaning-driven questions* about your contents (hence connecting your website to the Linked Data Cloud).

 * Organize your contents using "Concepts" (or Entities)
 * Treemap, Geomap and Entity List available as add-on Widgets
 * Multi-language support (see below)  
 * Attract more search traffic
 * Compatible with WordPress 3.3.0 and above
 * Eye-catching supplementary SERP data

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can this plug-in increase the content fundability of my blog? =

WordLift adds HTML Microdata using Schema.org vocabulary; Schema.org was designed by engineers from *Google*, *Yahoo* and *Bing* to make search engine results better and easier to use.
WordLift allows you to provide attributes for sections of your web pages, this makes it easier for the search engines to extract specific information from the content of your pages with less guessing and this is likely to result in more precise results, inclusion of more information in the search engine result page and a better ranking.

There are many factors that shall be consider and for an in-depth understanding of what Schema.org means for SEO we suggest you the reading of [this article](http://www.seoskeptic.com/what-schema-org-means-for-seo-and-beyond/ "What Schema.org Means for SEO and Beyond").

== Screenshots ==

1. WordLift button appears on the editor toolbar: by clicking it WordLift will send the text of your article to our content enrichment platform.
2. Here WordLift is analyzing the text provided and it is extracting the main content entities (limited to people and places for the current version); for each one it will query the semantic web and it will gather the information required by Schema.org to properly markup your pages.  
3. The entities WordLift found shall be selected using your mouse and holding Shift or Command Key (Apple users only). Once the article is saved the proper markup will be shown in the HTML of the page and it can then be tested with the [Google Rich Snippets Testing Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets)
