WordLift In-Depth

== Description ==

**In-Depth features**

The web is changing fast and search engines update the algorithms to find quality content. For editor it means to mark up their pages in the right way.

WordLift comes to the rescue with new **In-Depth features** that automatically add the correct semantic tagging for you, just download, install and activate WordLift.

Features:

 * Article
   * author
   * name
   * text
   * interactionCount
   * datePublished (Twenty Thirteen)

 * Organization (Avamsys)
   * logo
   * url

Since these tags are highly coupled with your WordPress theme, we list here the themes we tested so far:

 * Twenty Thirteen
 * Avamsys

Please let us know if your theme is working or not, and we'll try to add support for it.

The Plug-in is powered by [RedLink](http://redlink.co): Europe's *open source* largest platform for semantic enrichment and search.

= Which version of WordPress do you support? =

We currently support WordPress 3.3.0 or higher.

= What is an "entity"? =

An entity is something that exists in the real-world: celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, celestial objects and works of art are all entities. WordLift by reading your posts and pages understands the real-world entities associated with your contents as well as their relationships —in geek-speak— it builds a “graph” of your website.
